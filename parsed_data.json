        "text": "Services\nAdvertising\nThe Company’s advertising services include various third-party licensing arrangements and the Company’s own advertising platforms.\nAppleCare\nThe Company offers a portfolio of fee-based service and support products under the AppleCare® brand. The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical\nsupport, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of\naccidental damage and/or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product.\nCloud Services\nThe Company’s cloud services store and keep customers’ content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers.\nDigital Content\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store®, that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as\nbooks, music, video, games and podcasts.\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade®, a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+SM, a\npersonalized fitness service; Apple Music®, which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+®, a subscription news\nand magazine service; and Apple TV+®, which offers exclusive original content and live sports.\nPayment Services\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card®, a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay®, a cashless payment service.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its\nproducts and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and\ngovernment customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such\nas third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2022, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution\nchannels accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in\nproduct price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and\nbusinesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the\nCompany’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\nnumerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features\n(including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and\naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 2",

        "text": "The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well\nas established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines,\nlower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and\nlowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The\nCompany’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and\napplications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or\ncollaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from\nsingle or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,\ntablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times\nsubject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize\ncustom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the\nsuppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,\nmay be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s\nrequirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or\nrenew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers\nmanufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfully\ndepends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company\ncontinues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development\n(“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and\nservices. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although\nthe Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in\npart on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and\nmarketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and\nregistered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and\nservices. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third\nparties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the\nCompany has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be\nobtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 3",

        "text": "Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\nintroductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team\nmembers. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success. The\nCompany recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their\nprofessional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and\nresources that are designed to support employees’ individual growth and development.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company remains committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company\ncontinues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all\nemployees.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work\nenvironment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or\nconcerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop\nmeasures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific\nprograms in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team\nmembers, visitors and customers through its global security team. The Company has also taken additional health and safety measures during the COVID-19\npandemic.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to\nSections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the “SEC”). Such reports and other information filed by the Company with the SEC are available free of charge at investor.apple.com/investor-\nrelations/sec-filings/default.aspx when such reports are available on the SEC’s website.

        "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known\nor unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should\nnot be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nThis discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, the Company’s\nglobal supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the\nU.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and\nmonetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and\nmaterially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely\naffected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset\nvalues, energy shortages and cost increases, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors.\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a\nsignificant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nPotential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company’s products; and insolvency.\nA downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative\ncounterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the\nCompany’s financial instruments. These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and could in the future be\nmaterially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in\nresponse. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place\norders.

        "text": "The Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company’s operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many\nfactors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development,\navailability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the\nglobal economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse effects on demand\nfor the Company’s products and services, the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, the Company’s ability to execute its strategic plans,\nand the Company’s profitability and cost structure.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the\neffect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health\nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\ninterruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers,\nsuppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company believes that it\ngenerally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners\nlocated primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts\ncan result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, particularly if\nthese measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example,\ntensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business\nrestrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company’s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can\nadversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company’s products more expensive for customers, which\ncould make the Company’s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or\nexports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer its products\nand services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships,\nand ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company\nmay not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in\nresponse could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade\nand other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations\nthat are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power\nshortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks,\nlabor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate\nchange is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for\nthe Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and\nresult in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery\ntime, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the\nsupply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the\nCompany.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 6",

While the Company’s suppliers are\nrequired to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to\nthe Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have\nadversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer\nproducts; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement\nof products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of\ncurrent products and delays in production ramps of new products.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be\nunable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in\nproduct price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and\nbusinesses.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\nnumerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these\ninvestments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents,\ntrademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures,\nand by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every\ncountry in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if\ncompetitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in\nthese markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital\ncontent supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of\nactive devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have\nthe resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have\nfrom time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or\ncollaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate\nthe Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established\nservice offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes\nwith illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and\nservices to maintain their functional and design advantages.

        "text": "Business Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products\nand services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new\nproducts, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and\nservices, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions\ndepends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with\nproduction ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and\ninventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand,\nand the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage\nfuture introductions and transitions of products and services.\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are\nlocated outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland,\nIndia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing\npartners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and\nuncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs,\nthey also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an\nadverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing\nconditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains\nresponsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from\ntime to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time\nand can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing\npartners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a\nnegative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final\ndestinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes,\narmed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to\ncertain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if\nthese outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or\nterminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many\ncomponents, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing\nfluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor\nindustry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company’s ability to\nobtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has entered into agreements for the\nsupply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component\nsuppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting\nthe Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic\nconditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic\nconditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,” above, can\nalso affect the Company’s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that\ncan materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8",

        "text": "The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial\ncapacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these\ncomponents at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common\ncomponents instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product\nhas been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business,\nresults of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected\ndepending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nThe Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect\nthe Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating\nsystem software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of\nhardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make\nthe Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s\nproducts are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time\nexperience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company’s services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet\ncustomer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it\noffers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can\nbe exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible\nassets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for\nusers of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced\ndemand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation\nrisk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds\nnet realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews\nlong-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate\nthe assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the\ncarrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and\npurchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges\ngiven the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase\nobligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets\nare volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or\ninsufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or\nat all.\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In\naddition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent\ncoverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property\nrights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nBased on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the\nright to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain\nproducts or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9",

If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy\nthe Company’s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and\nanalysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’\nplatforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms.\nThis analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected\nfuture growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade\nsoftware for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger\nmarket share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products\nand operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of\nchange, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in\ndissatisfied customers.\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue\nthey generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The\nCompany may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, could require\nfurther changes. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company’s\nbusiness practices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for\naccess to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company\nearns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or\neliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable\nterms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party\ncontent, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can\nbe for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some\nthird-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or\nimpossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s\naccess to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices\nwith acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and\nsubscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased\ncosts for digital content.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the\nCompany may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions.

        "text": "The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to\ncompromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and could, among other things, impair the\nCompany’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships,\nand expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks\nare expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent\ncontrols, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from\nincidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various\nindustries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns,\nmanages, stores and processes.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of\nsensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies,\nthese security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system\nerror, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees or\ncustomers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or its\nvendors’ systems and services.

Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory\napprovals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise\nlimit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The\nfailure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to\nnumerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company’s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The\nCompany also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to\npromote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company’s\nmore typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company’s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an\nindividual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant\nlease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of\noperations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the\nCompany’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs\nassociated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 12",

        "text": "Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or\ngovernment investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet\nbeen fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions\nwhich can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and\ngovernment investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally\nincreased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the\nfuture. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on\nallegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several\nU.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and\ndisruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation\nand resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These\nagreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and\nlimit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, “Commitments and Contingencies” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was\nnot at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss\ncontingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified\nthird party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting\nperiod could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages,\ndisgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and can require the Company to change its business\npractices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of\nclaims that may arise.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased\ncosts and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data\nlocalization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership\nand infringement; digital platforms; internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party\nsoftware applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions;\nanti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, and climate change.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 13",

        "text": "Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by\nincreasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, impacting customer demand for the\nCompany’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also\ncreate uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and\nservices are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed\nto ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such\nlaws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect\nthe Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from\nsuch measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has\nprograms, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures\nwill be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be delayed or prohibited from importation, either of\nwhich could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs,\nreputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance\nconsiderations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In\naddition, the Company makes statements about its environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through its environmental, social and governance\nreport, its other non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental,\nsocial and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in\npart on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental,\nsocial and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived\nfailure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social\nand governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings\nagainst the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes\nthe Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The\nCompany may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, or similar laws in other jurisdictions,\ncould require further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages\ndistribution of apps outside of the App Store.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims\nagainst the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such\ninvestigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its\nApp Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also\nsubject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and\nlitigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners\nand materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing\narrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and apps, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject\nto government investigations and legal proceedings.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 14",

        "text": "There can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such\ninvestigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations\nor in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely\naffect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor\nmarket acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal\ninformation. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its\ninternational subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have\nlaws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing\nrequirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices.\nNoncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press\nstatements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or\ninternational privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In\naddition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific\nobligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial\ndata are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding\nthe Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data\nis handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to\nlitigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised,\nthe Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry\ndata security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment\ncards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the\nCompany’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure\ndue to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed\nproduct life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering\ncontent for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or\nin the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings;\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or\nservices with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company\ngenerates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The\nCompany could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new\nproduct or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply,\nor manufacturing partners.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 15",

        "text": "The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating\nexpenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers\ncould be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and\nearnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for\ncompetitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect\nthe U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and\nearnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit.\nAdditionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely\naffecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable\nmovements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political\nrisk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and\nnon-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents,\nand marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on\nthe Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply\nagreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company\nalso sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the\nCompany’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant\nportion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has\nunsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or\nassemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of\ninventory components. As of September 24, 2022, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were\nconcentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its\ntrade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and\navoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized.\nDue to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to\nsignificant change. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the\nvaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The\napplication of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 16",

The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its\nprovision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the\nU.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology\nindustry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in\nways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases\nits stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future\ngrowth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow,\nand that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and\nthe Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to\nfuture growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly, which could\nhave a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 2. Properties\nThe Company’s headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. As of September 24, 2022, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporate\nfunctions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes its\nexisting facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”) against the\nCompany alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The\nCompany filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to\nnine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern\nCalifornia District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an\ninjunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The\nCompany settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial\ncondition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting\nperiod for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially\nadversely affected.\nItem 4.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussions of\n2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nSeptember 25, 2021.\nFiscal Year Highlights\nFiscal 2022 Highlights\nTotal net sales increased 8% or $28.5 billion during 2022 compared to 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Mac. The weakness in\nforeign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on all Products and Services net sales during 2022.\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal 2022 included\nthe following:\nFirst Quarter 2022:\n• Updated MacBook Pro 14” and MacBook Pro 16”, powered by the Apple M1 Pro or M1 Max chip; and\n• Third generation of AirPods.\nSecond Quarter 2022:\n• Updated iPhone SE with 5G technology;\n• All-new Mac Studio, powered by the Apple M1 Max or M1 Ultra chip;\n• All-new Studio Display™; and\n• Updated iPad Air with 5G technology, powered by the Apple M1 chip.\nThird Quarter 2022:\n• Updated MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13”, both powered by the Apple M2 chip;\n• iOS 16, macOS Ventura, iPadOS 16 and watchOS 9, updates to the Company’s operating systems; and\n• Apple Pay Later, a buy now, pay later service.\nFourth Quarter 2022:\n• iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max;\n• Second generation of AirPods Pro; and\n• Apple Watch Series 8, updated Apple Watch SE and all-new Apple Watch Ultra.\nIn April 2022, the Company announced an increase to its Program authorization from $315 billion to $405 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.22 to\n$0.23 per share beginning in May 2022. During 2022, the Company repurchased $90.2 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents\nof $14.8 billion.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented\nmeasures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19\npandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19\npandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nCertain of the Company’s outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions during the COVID-19\npandemic, resulting in supply shortages. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 20",

        "text": "Manufacturing Purchase Obligations\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of\nfinished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire\ncomponents and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of September 24,\n2022, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $71.1 billion, with $68.4 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing\npurchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\nOther Purchase Obligations\nThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product\nmanufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to internet services and content creation. As of September 24, 2022, the Company had other purchase\nobligations of $17.8 billion, with $6.8 billion payable within 12 months.\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\nAs of September 24, 2022, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was $22.0 billion,\nwith $5.3 billion expected to be paid within 12 months.\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The Program does not obligate\nthe Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 24, 2022, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The Company\nintends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s\ndiscussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that\naffect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management\nbases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form\nthe basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain tax positions involves\nsignificant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the\nallocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given\nthat the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering\nchanging facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s\nexpectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain.\nThe Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires\nsignificant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s\nfinancial condition and operating results.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 25",

        "text": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with\nits underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company’s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature\nof the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign\nexchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses\nrelated to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company’s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is\nexposed to global interest rate fluctuations, it is most affected by fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on\nthe Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest\npaid on the Company’s debt.\nThe Company’s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company’s liquidity requirements. The Company\nuses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically\ninvests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s investment policy generally requires\nsecurities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk\nassociated with the Company’s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have\non the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September 24, 2022 and\nSeptember 25, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion incremental\ndecline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes and as of September 25, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate\nnotes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $110.1 billion and $118.7 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may\nenter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate\npayments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the\ncorresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the\nCompany’s debt as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\nForeign Currency Risk\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of\nthe U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to\nadjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with\ncertain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition,\nthe Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its\nforeign currency–denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue\nand inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of\nreasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 26",

The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair\nvalue, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended\nto represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum\none-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion as of September 24, 2022, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September 25, 2021.\nBecause the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by\nincreases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company’s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity\nanalyses performed as of September 24, 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates,\nforeign currency exchange rates and the Company’s actual exposures and positions.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 27",

        "text": "Apple Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany\naccounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ\nmaterially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to\nconform to the current period’s presentation.\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter\nevery five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which will occur in the first quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ending\nSeptember 30, 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years,\nquarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\nRevenue Recognition\nNet sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it\nexpects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present\nright to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered.\nPayment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as\napplicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the\nCompany’s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all\ndistinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine\nSSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance\nobligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices\ncharged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to\nprovide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other\nproducts. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered\nat the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps.\nThe third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled\nwith each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the\nCompany lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product\nis shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including estimated\nwarranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights are\nrecognized as cost of sales as incurred.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the\nCompany does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of\nthe undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 34",

        "text": "For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue\nbased on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products,\nincluding evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the\nproduct. For third-party applications sold through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores, the Company\ndoes not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by recognizing in\nServices net sales only the commission it retains.\nThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within other\ncurrent liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes\nexpense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest.

        "text": "Restricted Marketable Securities\nThe Company considers marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company reports restricted marketable\nsecurities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the\nshorter of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one and five years for machinery and equipment, including manufacturing equipment; and the\nshorter of the lease term or useful life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over\nthe estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five to seven years. Depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and equipment was $8.7\nbillion, $9.5 billion and $9.7 billion during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative gains and losses is based on\nintended use and hedge designation.\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in\nthe Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and recognizes it on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge\nrelates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss)\n(“OCI”).\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to the change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange\nforward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and\nrecognizes it in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.\nGains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges are recognized in the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative instruments relate.\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows related\nto derivative instruments as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.\nThe valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have\ncounterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by\nobservable market data.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the U.S. Tax Cuts and\nJobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”).\nLeases\nThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities.\nThe discount rates related to the Company’s lease liabilities are generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount\nrates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 36",

        "text": "Segment Reporting\nThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by\nmanagement for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s reportable segments.\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,\nJapan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and\nAfrica. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the\nCompany’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is\nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic\nregion. The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described elsewhere in this Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally\nbased on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment\nincludes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included\nin the geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain\nexpenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as research and\ndevelopment (“R&D”), corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other\nseparately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting\npurposes.\nNote 2 – Revenue\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n2022 2021 2020\niPhone (1) $ 205,489 $ 191,973 $ 137,781\nMac (1) 40,177 35,190 28,622\niPad (1) 29,292 31,862 23,724\nWearables, Home and Accessories (1)(2) 41,241 38,367 30,620\nServices (3) 78,129 68,425 53,768\nTotal net sales (4) $ 394,328 $ 365,817 $ 274,515\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective\nproduct.\n(2) Wearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod mini and accessories.\n(3) Services net sales include sales from the Company’s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and other services. Services net sales also include\namortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\n(4) Includes $7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021, $6.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2021\nthat was included in deferred revenue as of September 26, 2020, and $5.0 billion of revenue recognized in 2020 that was included in deferred revenue as of\nSeptember 28, 2019.\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 11, “Segment\nInformation and Geographic Data” for 2022, 2021 and 2020, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net\nsales in 2022 and 2021.\nAs of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.4 billion and $11.9 billion, respectively. As of September 24,\n2022, the Company expects 64% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 27% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years and 2%\nin greater than three years.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 37",

However, the Company may\nchoose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or\ninterest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other\ninstruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure\nassociated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company\nmay enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value\nhedges. As of September 24, 2022, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term\ndebt–related foreign currency transactions is 20 years.\nThe Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain\nassets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other\ninstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions):\n2022 2021\nDerivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts $ 102,670 $ 76,475\nInterest rate contracts $ 20,125 $ 16,875\nDerivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:\nForeign exchange contracts $ 185,381 $ 126,918\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 39",

To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally\nenters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from\ncontractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective\ncounterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party\nto the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of\ncollateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions):\n2022 2021\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\nCurrent and non-current marketable securities $ 13,378 $ 15,954\nCurrent and non-current term debt $ (18,739) $ (17,857)\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized\nbusinesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the\nCompany will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit\nrisk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-\nfinancing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any\nrecourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company’s\ncellular network carriers accounted for 44% and 42% of total trade receivables as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of September 24, 2022, the\nCompany had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%. As of\nSeptember 25, 2021, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for\n52%, 11% and 11%.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 40",

Although the timing of resolution and/or closure\nof examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by\nas much as $4.8 billion.\nEuropean Commission State Aid Decision\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and\n2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered\nIreland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of\nJanuary 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2\nbillion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On\nJuly 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to\nthe European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would\nbe creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act.\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other\ncountries. As of September 24, 2022, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded\ninto escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and\nMarketable Securities section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information.\nNote 6 – Leases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. These leases\ntypically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise.\nPayments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the\nunderlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for 2022,\n2021 and 2020, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $14.9 billion, $12.9 billion and $9.3 billion for 2022,\n2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company made $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Noncash\nactivities involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $2.8 billion for 2022, $3.3 billion for 2021 and $10.5 billion for 2020,\nincluding the impact of adopting the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) in the first quarter\nof 2020.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 43",

Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or\nstock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of\nDirectors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the\nvalue and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of the\nCompany’s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. RSUs\ngranted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The\nDirector Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled to DERs, which are subject to the same vesting and other\nterms and conditions as the underlying RSUs. A maximum of approximately 45 million shares (split-adjusted) were authorized for issuance pursuant to Director\nPlan awards at the time the plan was last amended on November 9, 2021.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved plan under which substantially all employees may voluntarily enroll to\npurchase the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning\nor the end of six-month offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s eligible compensation\nand employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. A maximum of approximately 230 million shares (split-adjusted) were\nauthorized for issuance under the Purchase Plan at the time the plan was last amended and restated on March 10, 2015.\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company’s 401(k) Plan is a tax-qualified deferred compensation arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan,\nparticipating U.S. employees may contribute a portion of their eligible earnings, subject to applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Service and plan limits. The\nCompany matches 50% to 100% of each employee’s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum of 6% of the employee’s eligible earnings.\nRestricted Stock Units\nA summary of the Company’s RSU activity and related information for 2022, 2021 and 2020, is as follows:\nNumber of Weighted-Average Aggregate\nRSUs Grant Date Fair Fair Value\n(in thousands) Value Per RSU (in millions)\nBalance as of September 28, 2019 326,068 $ 42.30\nRSUs granted 156,800 $ 59.20\nRSUs vested (157,743) $ 40.29\nRSUs canceled (14,347) $ 48.07\nBalance as of September 26, 2020 310,778 $ 51.58\nRSUs granted 89,363 $ 116.33\nRSUs vested (145,766) $ 50.71\nRSUs canceled (13,948) $ 68.95\nBalance as of September 25, 2021 240,427 $ 75.16\nRSUs granted 91,674 $ 150.70\nRSUs vested (115,861) $ 72.12\nRSUs canceled (14,739) $ 99.77\nBalance as of September 24, 2022 201,501 $ 109.48 $ 30,312\nThe fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $18.2 billion, $19.0 billion and $10.8 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The majority of\nRSUs that vested in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for\nthe applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 41\nmillion, 53 million and 56 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as\ndetermined by the Company’s closing stock price.

The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,\ntablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times\nsubject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize\ncustom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the\nsuppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,\nmay be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s\nrequirements.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers\nmanufactured in the U.S. and Ireland.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase\nobligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of payments for supplier arrangements, internet services and content creation.\nFuture payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 24, 2022, are as follows\n(in millions):\n2023 $ 13,488\n2024 4,876\n2025 1,418\n2026 6,780\n2027 312\nThereafter 412\nTotal $ 27,286\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The\noutcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a\nmaterial loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 48",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of Apple Inc. at September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended September 24, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 27, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccount or disclosure to which it relates.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in\nthe U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of\ngross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.8 billion, of which $8.0 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s\neffective tax rate. In accounting for uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the interpretation\nand application of complex domestic and international tax laws.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and\nthe measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based\non interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 50",

Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 27, 2022\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 52",

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act\nwere effective as of September 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or\nsubmits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and\n(ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s\nassets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\nGAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management\nand directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets\nthat could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent or\ndetect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of\ncontrols must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide\nabsolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)\nunder the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the\ncriteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013\nframework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nSeptember 24, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with\nmanagement’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 53",

The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical\nsupport, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of\naccidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product.\nCloud Services\nThe Company’s cloud services store and keep customers’ content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers.\nDigital Content\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store®, that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as\nbooks, music, video, games and podcasts.\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade®, a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+SM, a\npersonalized fitness service; Apple Music®, which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+®, a subscription news\nand magazine service; and Apple TV+®, which offers exclusive original content and live sports.\nPayment Services\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card®, a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay®, a cashless payment service.\nSegments\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,\nJapan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and\nAfrica. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the\nCompany’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is\nmanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic\nregion.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its\nproducts and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The\nCompany also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023,\nthe Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in\nproduct price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and\nbusinesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the\nCompany’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2",

        "text": "The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\nnumerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features\n(including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and\naccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well\nas established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines,\nlower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and\nlowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The\nCompany’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and\napplications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or\ncollaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from\nsingle or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,\ntablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times\nsubject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize\ncustom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the\nsuppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,\nmay be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s\nrequirements.\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or\nrenew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfully\ndepends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company\ncontinues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development\n(“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and\nservices. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although\nthe Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in\npart on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and\nmarketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and\nregistered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and\nservices. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third\nparties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the\nCompany has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be\nobtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3",

        "text": "Business Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product\nintroductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product\nlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers\nand distributors anticipate a product introduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team\nmembers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success. The\nCompany recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their\nprofessional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and\nresources that are designed to support employees’ individual growth and development.\nInclusion and Diversity\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company\ncontinues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all\nemployees.\nEngagement\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work\nenvironment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or\nconcerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\nHealth and Safety\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop\nmeasures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific\nprograms in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team\nmembers, visitors and customers through its global security team.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to\nSections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (the “SEC”).

Risk Factors\nThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known\nor unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of\noperations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should\nnot be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nThis discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, the Company’s\nglobal supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the\nU.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency\nfluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In\naddition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility,\ndeclines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions\ncan have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel\npartners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties\nand other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s financial\ninstruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health\nissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business\ninterruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers,\nsuppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5",

        "text": "The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company believes that it\ngenerally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners\nlocated primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on\nimports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to\noffer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions\nwhere the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company\nto take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing\nthe Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the\nCompany’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse\nimpacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions\nbeing imposed on the Company’s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly\nmore severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international\ndisputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations\nthat are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power\nshortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks,\nlabor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate\nchange is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense\neffects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in\nthe Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer\nspending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant\nexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many\ncritical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are\nrequired to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to\nthe Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have\nadversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer\nproducts; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement\nof products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the\nsupply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be\nunable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward\npressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in\nproduct price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and\nbusinesses.\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and\ntechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,\nnumerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these\ninvestments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6",

        "text": "The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents,\ntrademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures,\nand by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every\ncountry in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if\ncompetitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in\nthese markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital\ncontent supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of\nactive devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have\nthe resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have\nfrom time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or\ncollaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate\nthe Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established\nservice offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes\nwith illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and\nservices to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services\nthat compete effectively.\nBusiness Risks\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products\nand services.\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new\nproducts, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and\nservices, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions\ndepends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with\nnew technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s products, the effective management of purchase\ncommitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet\nanticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will\nsuccessfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are\nlocated outside of the U.S.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan,\nSouth Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often\nin single locations. Changes or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce\nthe Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the\nquality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although\narrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the\nconsumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time.\nWhile the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can\nmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7",

        "text": "The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing\npartners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a\nnegative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final\ndestinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes,\narmed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to\ncertain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if\nthese outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or\nterminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many\ncomponents, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing\nfluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor\nindustry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of\ncomponents and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into\nagreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or\nat all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular\nindustry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or\nregional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional\neconomic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,”\nabove, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price\nincreases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial\ncapacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these\ncomponents at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common\ncomponents instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product\nhas been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business,\nresults of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected\ndepending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\nThe Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect\nthe Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating\nsystem software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of\nhardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects\ncould make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the\nCompany’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from\ntime to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have not performed as anticipated and may\nnot meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and\nservices it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the\nCompany can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or\nintangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the\nexperience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market\nacceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8",

        "text": "The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation\nrisk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds\nnet realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews\nlong-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate\nthe assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the\ncarrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and\npurchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges\ngiven the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase\nobligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets\nare volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or\ninsufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or\nat all.\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In\naddition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent\ncoverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property\nrights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nBased on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially\nreasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the\nright to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain\nproducts or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and\nservices. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s\nproducts. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy\nthe Company’s products.\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and\nanalysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’\nplatforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms.\nThis analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected\nfuture growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade\nsoftware for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger\nmarket share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer.\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products\nand operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of\nchange, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in\ndissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company’s products.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9",

        "text": "The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue\nthey generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an\napplication. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the\nApp Store, such as the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject\nto litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in\nfurther changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\nFuture changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App\nStore, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This\ncould reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease.

The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices\nwith acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and\nsubscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers.\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the\nCompany may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license\nsuch solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.\nThe Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled\nemployees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel,\nincluding its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand\nand competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense\ncompetition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving.

These events could materially adversely\naffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant\nreputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company’s customers and\nemployees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures\nintended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential\ninformation occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are\nalso exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential\ninformation that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or\nunauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the\nCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to\ncompromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the\nCompany’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships,\nand expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks\nare expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent\ncontrols, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from\nincidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various\nindustries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns,\nmanages, stores and processes.\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of\nsensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies,\nthese security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system\nerror, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees or\ncustomers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or its\nvendors’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor\nauthentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can\nresult in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient\nto cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11",

        "text": "Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated\nand materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and\nuncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and\nregulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and\nintangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory\napprovals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise\nlimit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The\nfailure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company’s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of\noperations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the\nCompany’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs\nassociated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or\ngovernment investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet\nbeen fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions\nwhich can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and\ngovernment investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally\nincreased over time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the\nfuture, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents\nand seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is\nvigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions\nfrequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and\ndisruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation\nand resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These\nagreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and\nlimit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, “Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of\nmanagement, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual,\nconcerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified\nthird party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting\nperiod could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages,\ndisgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the\nfuture require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially\nadversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of\nclaims that may arise.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12",

New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by\nincreasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the\nCompany’s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain\nand its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied.\nThese risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial\nservices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no\nassurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the\nCompany is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance\nnotice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing\nregulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy\nregulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a\nresult, the Company’s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business,\nreputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential\nliabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance\nconsiderations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In\naddition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press\nstatements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and\ninitiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company’s control.\nThe Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders\nmay disagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its\npublic statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied\nstakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes\nthe Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal\nand regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the\nApp Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes\nhave included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also\naffect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what\nextent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13",

For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such\ninvestigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its\nApp Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also\nsubject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and\nlitigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners\nand materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing\narrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently\nsubject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\nThere can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such\ninvestigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.

In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the\nCompany and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional\nrestrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and\nchanging requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business\npractices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press\nstatements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or\ninternational privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In\naddition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific\nobligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial\ndata are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding\nthe Company’s compliance with these obligations.

        "text": "Financial Risks\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the\nCompany’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure\ndue to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in\nresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed\nproduct life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering\ncontent for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or\nin the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings;\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or\nservices with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company\ngenerates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The\nCompany could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new\nproduct or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply,\nor manufacturing partners.\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses\nworldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the\npast been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and\nearnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for\ncompetitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect\nthe U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and\nearnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit.\nAdditionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely\naffecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable\nmovements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political\nrisk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations\nand financial condition.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15",

        "text": "The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply\nagreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company\nalso sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the\nCompany’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant\nportion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has\nunsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or\nassemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of\ninventory components. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were\nconcentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its\ntrade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and\navoid losses.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries\nare organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be\nsubject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing\ninternational tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of\nearnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes\nin tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and\ngovernmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its\nprovision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate\ndetermination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nGeneral Risks\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology\nindustry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in\nways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases\nits stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future\ngrowth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow,\nand that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and\nthe Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to\nfuture growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly, which could\nhave a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\nItem 1B.

Legal Proceedings\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “District Court”) against the Company alleging\nviolations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. On September 10,\n2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim. The District Court found that certain\nprovisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from\nprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The\ninjunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Circuit\nCourt”) affirmed the District Court’s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision.\nOn June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied both petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple’s motion to stay enforcement of the injunction\npending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the U.S. Supreme Court denies Apple’s petition, the stay of the injunction will expire.\nMasimo\nMasimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (together, “Masimo”) filed a complaint before the U.S. International Trade Commission (the “ITC”) alleging\ninfringement by the Company of five patents relating to the functionality of the blood oxygen feature in Apple Watch Series 6 and 7. In its complaint, Masimo\nsought a permanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to the United States of certain Apple Watch models that include blood oxygen sensing functionality.\nOn October 26, 2023, the ITC entered a limited exclusion order (the “Order”) prohibiting importation and sales in the United States of Apple Watch models with\nblood oxygen sensing functionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Order will not go into effect until the end of the administrative review\nperiod, which is currently expected to end on December 25, 2023. The Company intends to appeal the Order and seek a stay pending the appeal.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The\nCompany settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial\ncondition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting\nperiod for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially\nadversely affected.\nItem 4.

Under the programs, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans\ncomplying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.\n(2) In August 2023, the Company entered into new accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ASRs”). Under the terms of the ASRs, two financial institutions\ncommitted to deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase periods in exchange for up-front payments totaling $5.0 billion. The total\nnumber of shares ultimately delivered under the ASRs, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted\naverage price of the Company’s common stock during the ASRs’ purchase periods, which end in the first quarter of 2024.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 18",

Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management\nbases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form\nthe basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain tax positions involves\nsignificant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the\nallocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given\nthat the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering\nchanging facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s\nexpectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain.\nThe Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires\nsignificant judgment.

        "text": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks;\nhowever, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in\ninterest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect\nagainst interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment\nand term debt portfolios.\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that\nwould result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (dollars in millions):\nInterest Rate Hypothetical Interest\nSensitive Instrument Rate Increase Potential Impact 2023 2022\nInvestment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenors Decline in fair value $ 3,089 $ 4,022\nTerm debt 100 basis points, all tenors Increase in annual interest expense $ 194 $ 201\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in\nexchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S.\ndollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate\nrisk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may\nchoose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates.\nThe VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign\ncurrency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum\none-day loss in fair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying\nforeign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign currency\nderivatives.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 26",

        "text": "Note 2 – Revenue\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers.\nControl is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or\nservices are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s\nServices net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following\ntransfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the\nCompany’s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all\ndistinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine\nSSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance\nobligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices\ncharged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to\nprovide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other\nproducts. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered\nat the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps.\nThe third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled\nwith each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the\nCompany lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product\nis shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the\nCompany does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of\nthe undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue\nbased on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products,\nincluding evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the\nproduct. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer.\nTherefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 34",

The Company classifies marketable debt\nsecurities as either current or non-current based solely on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may\nchoose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular\nexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or\ninterest rates.\nThe Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being\nhedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these\ninstruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory\npurchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use\nforwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 30,\n2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency\ntransactions is 19 years.\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities\ndenominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other\ninstruments.

To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally\nuses collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from\ncontractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally uses master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to\nthe Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of\nSeptember 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would\nbe a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\n2023 2022\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\nCurrent and non-current marketable securities $ 14,433 $ 13,378\nCurrent and non-current term debt $ (18,247) $ (18,739)\nAccounts Receivable\nTrade Receivables\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company’s\nthird-party cellular network carriers accounted for 41% and 44% of total trade receivables as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. The\nCompany requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect\nthe sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the\nrelated final products are sold by the Company. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total\nvendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 48% and 23%.

A valuation allowance has been recorded for the credit carryforwards and a portion of other temporary\ndifferences.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs of September 30, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $19.5 billion, of which $9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact the\nCompany’s effective tax rate. As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.8 billion, of which $8.0 billion, if\nrecognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate.\nThe aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2023, 2022 and 2021, is as follows (in\nmillions):\n2023 2022 2021\nBeginning balances $ 16,758 $ 15,477 $ 16,475\nIncreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year 2,044 2,284 816\nDecreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year (1,463) (1,982) (1,402)\nIncreases related to tax positions taken during the current year 2,628 1,936 1,607\nDecreases related to settlements with taxing authorities (19) (28) (1,838)\nDecreases related to expiration of the statute of limitations (494) (929) (181)\nEnding balances $ 19,454 $ 16,758 $ 15,477\nThe Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. Tax years after 2017 for\nthe U.S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution or closure of\nexaminations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as\nmuch as $4.5 billion.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 41",

        "text": "European Commission State Aid Decision\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and\n2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered\nIreland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of\nJanuary 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2\nbillion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On\nJuly 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to\nthe European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company\nbelieves it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid\nDecision.\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other\ncountries. As of September 30, 2023, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded\ninto escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and\nMarketable Securities section of Note 4, “Financial Instruments” for more information.\nNote 8 – Leases\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. These leases\ntypically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise.\nPayments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the\nunderlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the Company’s operating leases were $2.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion for 2023,\n2022 and 2021, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $13.9 billion, $14.9 billion and $12.9 billion for 2023,\n2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company made $1.9 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion of fixed cash payments related to operating leases in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Noncash\nactivities involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $2.1 billion, $2.8 billion and $3.3 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\nThe following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated financial statement line items, as of September 30, 2023 and September 24,\n2022 (in millions):\nLease-Related Assets and Liabilities Financial Statement Line Items 2023 2022\nRight-of-use assets:\nOperating leases Other non-current assets $ 10,661 $ 10,417\nFinance leases Property, plant and equipment, net 1,015 952\nTotal right-of-use assets $ 11,676 $ 11,369\nLease liabilities:\nOperating leases Other current liabilities $ 1,410 $ 1,534\nOther non-current liabilities 10,408 9,936\nFinance leases Other current liabilities 165 129\nOther non-current liabilities 859 812\nTotal lease liabilities $ 12,842 $ 12,411\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 42",

        "text": "Share-Based Compensation\nThe following table shows share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for\n2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):\n2023 2022 2021\nShare-based compensation expense $ 10,833 $ 9,038 $ 7,906\nIncome tax benefit related to share-based compensation expense $ (3,421) $ (4,002) $ (4,056)\nAs of September 30, 2023, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding RSUs was $18.6 billion, which the Company expects to recognize\nover a weighted-average period of 2.5 years.\nNote 12 – Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nThe Company has entered into certain off–balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase\nobligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and\ndistribution rights. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 30,\n2023, are as follows (in millions):\n2024 $ 4,258\n2025 2,674\n2026 3,434\n2027 1,277\n2028 5,878\nThereafter 3,215\nTotal $ 20,736\nContingencies\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The\noutcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a\nmaterial loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from\nsingle or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,\ntablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times\nsubject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize\ncustom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the\nsuppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,\nmay be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s\nrequirements.\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South\nKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 46",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of Apple Inc. at September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating\nthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to\nbe communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccount or disclosure to which it relates.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in\nthe U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of\ngross unrecognized tax benefits was $19.5 billion, of which $9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s\neffective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the\ninterpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws.\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and\nthe measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based\non interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 49",

We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of\nApple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing\nauthorities.

In our opinion, Apple\nInc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), the consolidated\nbalance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income,\nshareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated\nNovember 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nApple Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and\nare required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nNovember 2, 2023\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51",

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act\nwere effective as of September 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or\nsubmits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and\n(ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s\nassets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with\nGAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management\nand directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets\nthat could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent or\ndetect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\nobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of\ncontrols must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide\nabsolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future\nperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)\nunder the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the\ncriteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013\nframework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of\nSeptember 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection with\nmanagement’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 52",
